Introduction

I wrote a formal enquiry as part of GCAP3226 to request flu vaccination and demographic data from government sources. The task helped me situate the project within Hong Kong's data environment and clarified what evidence I can realistically obtain for my analysis.

Main Body

I learned that Hong Kong offers a substantial amount of open data through platforms like data.gov.hk and the Census and Statistics Department API, but many granular, linkable datasets (for example vaccination status tied to hospitalization) are not openly available and require formal requests. Drafting the enquiry forced me to be specific about variables, time ranges, and formats—skills I previously underestimated. Working with the AI agent sped up drafting and wording; it suggested professional phrasing and ensured completeness, though I still had to verify data availability and interpretation. Compared to a customized chatbot tutor, the AI here was more task-focused (drafting and file operations) and less explanatory about policy context. This collaboration developed my ability to translate research needs into precise requests and to prepare backup plans when data is unobtainable.

Conclusion

Overall, the exercise reinforced that data-driven policymaking relies on both accessible open data and strategic engagement with government channels. If requests fail, I will rely on public APIs, surveys, or proxy measures. The skills gained—formal communication, targeted data requests, and effective AI collaboration—will improve my future policy analysis.
