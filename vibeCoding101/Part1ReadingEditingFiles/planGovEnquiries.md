# Plan for Government Enquiries: Flu Vaccination Project

## Analysis of the Flu Vaccination Project

### Key Findings
- The project focuses on analyzing flu vaccination campaigns and public health policy effectiveness in Hong Kong.
- Main research questions include:
  - What is the causal relationship between vaccination rates and infection/hospitalization rates?
  - How effective are school-based outreach programs?
  - Can targeting vulnerable populations (e.g., those with chronic conditions) improve program effectiveness?
  - Do alternative administration methods (e.g., nasal spray) increase participation?

### Data Needs & Gaps
- **Missing Data:**
  - Vaccination participation rates by age, income, and eligibility.
  - Hospitalization and infection rates correlated with vaccination status.
  - School-based program outcomes.
  - Survey data on barriers and facilitators for different population segments.
  - Data on alternative administration methods and their uptake.
- **Needed for Modeling:**
  - Conditional probability tables for population segments.
  - Bayesian decision theory inputs.
  - Resource allocation and epidemiological data.

### Departments to Contact
- **Department of Health:** For vaccination participation data, campaign planning documents, and effectiveness metrics.
- **Hospital Authority:** For infection and hospitalization data linked to vaccination status.
- **Education Bureau:** For school-based program outcomes and participation rates.
- **Census and Statistics Department:** For demographic data.

## Plan for Sending Enquiries to Government Departments

1. **Department of Health**
   - Request quantitative data on vaccination rates by demographic group and eligibility.
   - Ask for reports or documents on campaign planning and resource allocation.
   - Inquire about criteria for evaluating campaign success.

2. **Hospital Authority**
   - Request data on flu-related hospitalizations and infections, segmented by vaccination status and age group.
   - Ask about data collection methods and availability of anonymized datasets.

3. **Education Bureau**
   - Request information on school-based vaccination program outcomes.
   - Ask for participation rates and any available assessment reports.

4. **Census and Statistics Department**
   - Request demographic data relevant to vaccination campaigns (age, income, district).

5. **Survey Data**
   - Plan to conduct primary research to fill gaps on barriers and facilitators to vaccination.

## Next Steps

- Draft enquiry emails using the provided template in the project roadmap.
- Log all requests and responses in a shared document.
- Consolidate received data and identify any remaining gaps for follow-up.
